/******************************/

The purpose of this repository is to provide a tool for the PC game Age of Empires 2: The Conquerors.
This tool can generate fair teams for 2v2, 3v3 and 4v4 game modes based on the players' rating.

Usage:
  The tool reads input from the standard input.

  1) Provide the number of players (4, 6 and 8 are allowed only).
  2) Provide the nickname of a given player
  3) Provide the corresponding rating value
  
  As a result, the tool prints out the calculated fair teams, which has the lowest difference between their average ratings.
